         <h1>Types of Martial Arts</h1>
        <h2>Jeet Kune Do</h2>
        <p>Created by Bruce Lee based on Wing Chun, it is a free boxing art that combines various martial arts essentials. It is actually a method of defending the opponent’s attack. 
        <br>
        <p>Its superiority is to defend and attack in a close distance and short duration. Besides, if it is flexibly used, the shortcomings or weaknesses of other boxing skills can be easily detected and compromised.</p>

        <h2>Nunchakus</h2>
       <p>Nunchakus is actually two pieces of round wood linked by a short iron chain or a leather belt. Lee was good at using it as a weapon. The weapon can attack violently by brandishing the wood. Once the iron chain or the leather belt wraps one’s neck, it’s difficult to get rid of it. His prowess in its use can be seen in the Green Hornet and the Way of the Dragon.</p>

        <h2>Inch Boxing (Cun Quan)</h2>
       <p>Inch Boxing gets the name because the distance between the attacker and the enemy is very close. It features a particular attack style which explodes in great strength to attack the close enemy in split seconds.</p>
